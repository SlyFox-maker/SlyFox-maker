### 🌟 About Me :

</div>

- **👋 Introduction**  
  Hi there! I’m a passionate **Web & App Developer** who started programming as a hobby and eventually turned it into a career. After enrolling in an international university and taking various courses, I’ve built a strong foundation in development and continue to learn every day.

- **🔍 Problem Solving**  
  What I love most about programming is solving problems and finding creative, out-of-the-box solutions. Breaking boundaries and pushing limits is what keeps me excited.

- **💻 Technologies I Use**  
  My go-to languages and frameworks include **JavaScript**, **C#**, **Python**, **PHP**, **jQuery**, **Django**, **Laravel**, and **Bootstrap**. I enjoy experimenting with different technologies and finding the best tools for each project.

- **🎮 Notable Projects**  
  - A **Minecraft plugin** I developed in **Java**, which completely transformed the game into a survival experience with custom NPCs, a unique storyline, and multiple endings.  
  - A **file-sharing website** I created using **Django**, which has become my own personal version of Google Drive.

- **🤝 Teamwork**  
  I thrive in team environments because I love collaborating and exchanging ideas with people in my field. It’s not just about the work—it’s about building connections, having interesting conversations, and learning from others. But I also enjoy individual projects where I can take full ownership and explore new concepts on my own.

- **🚀 Motivation**  
  What motivates me is the constant drive to become a better version of myself. I aim to grow, learn, and continuously improve, both as a developer and as a person.

- **🌟 Dream Project**  
  My ultimate dream is to create an **app** that would be used by many people, providing real value and making a positive impact. I’d love to manage it, interact with users, gather feedback, and maybe even build a team to help take it to the next level.
